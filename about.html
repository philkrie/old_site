                Hello! My name is Phillip Kriegel. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I am currently a student at the University of Oregon. I was born in Vancouver, British Columbia before moving to rainy Beaverton, Oregon. I then went on to attend the University of Oregon where I am completing a double major in COmputer Science and Mathematics, as well as a minor in Spanish.
                </p>

                <p>
                I have worked for several groups on campus as a web developer during my time as a Duck. I am a member of the University of Oregon Mock Trial Team, and I am their web developer as well. I also work for the UO Study Abroad Office as a web developer, working with both Drupal and JS full stack.
                </p>

                <p>
                I have also interned at DISH Network as an IT Intern, where I assisted the Work Force Management Team in streamlining some of their processes and creating business plans to change some of their call system infrastructure. As such, I have experience with both the business and technology sides of IT and software development. As such, a great fit for me is any position that requires both technical expertise as well as customer and business interaction.
                </p>

                <p>
                I am currently in the process of writing a thesis for the Robert D. Clark Honors College, as well as for the Oregon CS department. It is tentitavely titled <strong>"Determining the Location of Autonomous System Relations Among Top Tier Internet Service Providers in the United States"</strong>. I am working currently with the Oregon Network Research Group with professor Reza Rejaie, and as such have experience with networking and internet structure.
                </p>

                <p>
                At the end of the day, what I want to do is to solve problems. I want to fix things. I want to create things. To me, that exhiliration is worth the hours of frustration that you sometimes encounter. To work on a problem and to truly master it is its own reward.
                </p>
